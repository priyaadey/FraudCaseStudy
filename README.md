## Proposal:
Develop a case that addresses fraud risks in a corporate environment and leverages the use of information technology in optimizing fraud detection and mitigating risk. We cover specific instances of fraud (financial statement fraud, credit card fraud, and expense reimbursement fraud).

## Database Information

This is a mock database that can be viewed as either an extension of Workday's current database or Crowe's internal expense reimbursement database.


## Financial Fraud Detection 

### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
• The problem at hand involves the manipulation of sales figures, overstatement of assets, accounts receivable, and concealment within financial statements. These fraudulent activities undermine the accuracy and integrity of financial reporting, posing significant risks to organizational  transparency and compliance. 
### RESEARCH INSIGHTS
• Existing methods rely on predefined rules and human supervision, limiting effectiveness against evolving fraud schemes and analyzing large volumes of unstructured data.
### PROPOSED SOLUTION
• Implementing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to: 
  o Adaptability: ML algorithms continuously learn from historical data to detect new fraud patterns without relying solely on predefined rules. 
  o Enhanced Analysis: AI capabilities extend to analyzing unstructured data formats like images and PDFs, significantly increasing the scope and depth of fraud detection.  
  o Scalability: Addressing the limitation of smaller data sample sizes with ML enables more comprehensive fraud analysis.


# Credit Card Fraud

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Credit card fraud remains a significant concern due to vulnerabilities in data security and the adaptability of fraudsters to circumvent traditional detection methods.
### RESEARCH INSIGHTS
• Companies face ongoing challenges in swiftly adapting to new fraud techniques, resulting in occasional lapses in detection effectiveness.
### PROPOSED SOLUTION
• Leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) for enhanced pattern recognition and detection capabilities offers a proactive approach. ML algorithms trained on historical data minimize false positives, thereby reducing customer inconvenience and inaccurate fraud alerts. By combining diverse attributes such as location and purchase time intervals, ML models can identify nuanced fraudulent activities that evade traditional  rule-based systems.
### REBUTTAL TO CONCERNS
• Acknowledging ML's inherent limitations in achieving 100% accuracy, deep neural networks are employed to optimize detection outcomes while mitigating customer impact. Despite fraudsters also leveraging AI, corporations possess superior access to comprehensive datasets, which when organized and leveraged effectively, enhance their detection capabilities.

# Expense Reimbursement Fraud

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Instances of small-scale expense reimbursement fraud pose financial risks to organizations.
### RESEARCH INSIGHTS
• Companies face ongoing challenges in swiftly adapting to new fraud techniques, resulting in occasional lapses in detection effectiveness.
### PROPOSED SOLUTION
• Introducing CrowePAY, an app-based solution akin to Apple Pay, streamlines expense submission and verification processes.
### KEY FEATURES
• Instances of small-scale expense reimbursement fraud pose financial risks to organizations.
• Companie
• Introd

• Direct Payment: Integration with corporate credit cards simplifies transactions, eliminating the need for manual receipt uploads.
• Automated Reporting: Selecting projects triggers automatic weekly expense reports, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
• Verification Process: Utilizing Crowe's proprietary database, SQL codes cross-check receipt IDs to validate expense authenticity. An intuitive interface allows users and managers to verify, reject, or request additional information, ensuring thorough review and approval processes.
